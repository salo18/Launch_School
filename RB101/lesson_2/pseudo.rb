# write out pseudo-code (both casual and formal) that does the following:

# 1. a method that returns the sum of two integers
# Casual:
# - create a method that takes two arguments
# - sum both integers
# - return the result

# Formal:
# START

# define method that takes two arguments 

# GET two numbers from the user 

# Sum both numbers 

# PRINT the output 

# END

# 2. a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those 
# strings concatenated together

# Casual:
# ask user for an array of strings 
# use string interpolation or arithmetic to add all the strings into one large array

# 3. a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other 
# element
# ask user for an array of integers
# set an index value to each integer
# return only integers with an even number index
