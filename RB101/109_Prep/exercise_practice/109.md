`line 8` doesnâ€™t raise an exception because a new local variable `n` is initialized inside the method definition. Method definitions create their own scope and since `n` is initialized inside the method, it is accessible. Local variable `x` is initialized on `line 6` and passed in as an argument on `line 8`.

The code on `line 10` outputs `4` and returns `nil` because local variable `n` initialized on `line 5` is not affected by the reassignment happening on the method invocation on `line 8`. The code on `line 2` happens to initialize a new local variable `n` that shares the same name as the variable initialized on `line 5` but these two variables are not connected in any way because method definitions create their own scope and cannot access variables initialized outside the method definition unless passed in as an argument.

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
new_arr = []

arr.each do |num|
  new_arr << num * 2
end

p new_arr # => [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]




def double(x)
  n = 2 * x
end

n = 4
x = 3

double(n)

puts n
