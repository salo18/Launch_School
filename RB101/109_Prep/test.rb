Given two strings, return the characters that are not common in the two strings.

# PROBLEM
Input: 2 strings
Output: string
Questions:
- what should we return?
- lettercase
- non-alphabetic characters?
- number of occurrences of characters?

# EXAMPLES
p unique_string_characters("xyab","xzca") == "ybzc"
p unique_string_characters("a","z") == "az"
p unique_string_characters("abcd","de") == "abce"
p unique_string_characters("abc","abba") == "c"
p unique_string_characters("xyz","zxy") == ""

Main Task:
- remove characters that are in common, and return the ones that aren't

Requirements:
- order should be retained from the input strings - characters from first string would come first, then the characters from the second string
- order isn't important in terms of input string
- input strings can be of different lengths
- number of occurrences is irrelevant in determining common characters
- if all the characters are in common, return an empty string
- only need to deal with lowercase alphabetic characters

# DATA STRUCTURES
Input: string
Output: string
- array?

# ALGORITHM

Justin:
=begin
def unique_string_characters(string1,string2)
  initialize an empty array
  loop
    take first letter of string1
    compare it to string2
    if there is no match, put it in array
    go to next character
  end

end


Leo:
1.We want to define a method that takes two string parameters,
2. Check to see if any characters in the two string parameters match.
3. Return the value of the characters that do not match
4. Print the return value to the screen to make sure it works.
Which method removes the the found characters from the strings?



Roni:
  **mental model:** take two strings and iterate over each character to find the uncommon characters between the two strings. Return a new string containing the uncommon characters.

1) Create an empty string called `new_array` that will contain the new string of uncommon characters
2) Create a method called `unique_string_characters`that takes in two strings as parameters.
3) In this method, compare the two parameters. For every character in the first string, determine if there is at least one idential character in the second string.
4) Save the uncommon characters in the `new_array` string.
5) Return the `new_array` string.

- accept two strings (`str1` and `str2`) as arguments
- create an empty array (`result`) for resulting characters

- break down first string (`str1`) into individual characters
- look at each character (`char`)
  - if the character (`char`) is not included in the second string (`str2`)
    - add it to the results array (`result`)
  - otherwise
    - move onto the next character

- break down second string (`str2`) into individual characters
- look at each character (`char`)
  - if the character (`char`) is not included in the first string (`str1`)
    - add it to the results array (`result`)
  - otherwise
    - move onto the next character

- combine all characters in the results array (`result`) into a single string
- return the final string
