Exercises that were hard for me:

Easy1:
- exercise 3 - did not figure out to map {|x| x.to_i}
- exercise 4 - could not figure out how to get element count and put it into a hash
- exercise 7 - can't figure out how to print 101010 sequence based on number

def fix(v)
  v = v.upcase!
  v.concat("!")
end
