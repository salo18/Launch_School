# Create a method that takes two arguments, multiplies them together, and
# returns the result.

def multiply(num1, num2)
  puts num1 * num2
end

# need to focus on the method's return value
# can't use puts because this always has a return value of nil



multiply([5,2], 3) == 15

# if the argument is an array it will print the array num2 amount of times
