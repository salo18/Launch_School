Initial PEDAC:
1. Initialize deck
  - dealer hand
  - player hand
array of 52 card values
  - declare constants for Jack, Queen, King
  - How to determine the value of Ace? A separate method
2. Deal cards to player and dealer
  - use #sample so need to use an array
  - how to keep track of cards that have already been dealt and thus no longer in play?
    - if a card is dealt to either player or dealer, it needs to be taken out of the deck and put into a "dead" array?
3. Player turn: hit or stay
  - ask player what to do next?
    - repeat until bust or "stay"
4. If player bust, dealer wins.
5. Dealer turn: hit or stay
  - repeat until total >= 17
6. If dealer bust, player wins.
7. Compare cards and declare winner.

methods to make:
- deal card
- subtract dealt card from deck so it can't be reused
- what is the value of ACE?
- what is bust?
- compare cards
- declare winner
