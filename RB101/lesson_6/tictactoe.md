My Pseudocode:

What is tic tac toe:
Tic tac toe is a two player game played on a square 3x3 board. Each player is
assigned a role (either X or O). X always starts and can put an X anywhere on the board. O goes next and can place an O anywhere on the board that is not currently used by X. X and O continue taking turns until either one has created a straight line or a diagonal line of 3 OR a stalemate.

High level process:
1. welcome the user and explain the rules
2. display initial empty board
3. user places an X
4. computer automatically goes next
5. if winner, display winner
6. if board is full, display tie
7. if neither winner or tie, go to #2
8. Play again?
9. if yes, go to 2
10. goodbye
