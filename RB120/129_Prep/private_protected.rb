T of F?
Public methods have no access control - they can be called from the outside of the class definition by the instance of
that class or itâ€™s subclasses.
  # True
Both protected and private methods cannot be called from the outside of the defining class.
  # True
Protected methods are accessible from the subclass and private methods are not.
  # False -- both are accessible from subclasses
Private methods of the defining class can be invoked by any instance of that class.
  # False -- can't be called by an explicit receiver -- is an explicit receiver an instance of a class???
Public access is the default one.
  # True

  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PRIVATE AND PROTECTED METHODS... private can't be called on an explicit receiver
