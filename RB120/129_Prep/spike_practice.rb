Preschool (by Natalie Thompson)

# Inside a preschool there are children, teachers, class assistants, a principle, janitors, and cafeteria workers.
# Both teachers and assistants can help a student with schoolwork and watch them on the playground.
# A teacher teaches
# assistant helps kids with any bathroom emergencies.
# Kids themselves can learn and play.
# A teacher and principle can supervise a class.
# Only the principle has the ability to expel a kid.
# Janitors have the ability to clean.
# Cafeteria workers have the ability to serve food.
# Children, teachers, class assistants, principles, janitors and cafeteria workers all have the ability to eat lunch.

# This exercise asks you to come up with a class design for a Role-playing Game.

# The application has information about every player. They all have a name, health, strength and intelligence.

# When each player is created, it gets:

# a health value of 100
# a random strength value (between 2 and 12, inclusive)
# a random intelligence value (between 2 and 12 inclusive)
# The random values are determined by a call to a #roll_dice method that cannot be accessed outside of the class.

# You can set and change the strength and intelligence in the constructors. However, once an object is constructed, the values may not change.

# Health can only be changed by the methods #heal and #hurt. Each method accepts one argument, the amount of change to the health. The #heal increases the health value by the indicated amount, while the #hurt decreases the value.

# A player can be a warrior, a paladin, a magician, or a bard.

# Warriors receive an additional 2 points of strength when they're created. The resulting strength range is thus between 4 and 14, inclusive.

# Magicians receive an additional 2 points of intelligence when they're created. The resulting intelligence range is thus between 4 and 14, inclusive.

# Warriors and paladins have the ability to wear armor. They need access to 2 additional methods: #attach_armor and #remove_armor.

# Paladins, magicians and bards can cast spells. They need access to a #cast_spell method, that accepts one argument, spell.

# Bards are a special type of magician that can also create potions. They have a #create_potion method.

If you pass a player instance to #puts, it should print information about the player in this format:
Name: John
Class: Warrior
Health: 100
Strength: 7
Inteligence: 5

You're designing a Pet Shelter App that tracks dogs and cats that are in the shelter, and have identified three classes
that you need: PetShelter, Dog, and Cat. Each PetShelter has one or more Dogs and one or more Cats. In our application, the
Dogs and Cats don't interact directly, and neither needs to know anything about the PetShelter to which they belong.

Given the above details, what kind of Object Oriented relationship (inheritance, mixin, collaboration, or none) should
exist between objects of each pair of classes, and why?

PetShelter and Dog
PetShelter and Cat
Cat and Dog
